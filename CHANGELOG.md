## [Phase 3 — chunking] — in progress on feat/chunking

- **fix(ingestion):** `clean_text` now drops private-use area glyphs (Co category) and non-printing format characters (Cf), closing issue #17. Verified against the real NPS 10-K (4 distinct Co codepoints: 0xf020, 0xf078, 0xf0a8, 0xf0b7).
- **fix(ingestion):** `_detect_headings` rejects long all-caps cover lines (>60 chars) and table labels ("2013 2012 2011 2009 (in thousands)") with a table-label pattern.
- **feat(chunking):** three strategies (fixed_size, recursive, structure_aware) with deterministic chunk IDs, table splitting by rows with header repetition, and quality filtering.
- **feat(chunking):** `chunk_ends_with_complete_sentence` added as the complement of `chunk_ends_mid_sentence`; structure-aware now splits oversized paragraphs by sentence boundary before character fallback, reducing mid-sentence rate from 20.5% to 15.5% on NPS.
- **fix(chunking):** "Item NN." headings detected by pattern in both ingestion and chunker fallback; inline headings split off their own line; trailing orphan headings dropped.
